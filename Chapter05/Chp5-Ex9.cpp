// Note: The constructor member initialization list was originally created to provide a manner to initialize data members
// that are const or references. However, it can additionally (and preferably) be used as an efficient way to fully initialize
// virtually any data member.

    // However, as this is the default action for member objects (string), we donâ€™t need to explicitly include
    // these members in the member initialization list (nor will we include them in future examples).
