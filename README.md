**A practical, in-depth guide to implementing object-oriented design principles to create robust code**

## What is this book about?
Even though object-oriented software design enables more easily maintainable code, companies choose C++ as an OO language for its speed. Object-oriented programming in C++ is not automatic – it is crucial to understand OO concepts and how they map to both C++ language features and OOP techniques. Distinguishing your code by utilizing well-tested, creative solutions, which can be found in popular design patterns, is crucial in today’s marketplace. This book will help you to harness OOP in C++ to write better code. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Quickly learn core C++ programming skills to develop a base for essential OOP features in C++
* Implement OO designs using C++ language features and proven programming techniques
* Understand how well-designed, encapsulated code helps make more easily maintainable software
* Write robust C++ code that can handle programming exceptions
* Design extensible and generic code using templates
* Apply operator overloading, utilize STL, and perform OO component testing
* Examine popular design patterns to provide creative solutions for typical OO problems

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
class Humanoid: private Person // Humanoid is abstract
{ 
protected:
 void SetTitle(const string &t) { ModifyTitle(t); }
public:
 Humanoid() = default; 
 Humanoid(const string &, const string &, 
 const string &, const string &);
 // class definition continues 
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
Programmers wanting to utilize C++ for OOP will find this book essential to understand how to implement OO designs in C++ through both language features and refined programming techniques while creating robust and easily maintainable code. This OOP book assumes prior programming experience; however, if you have limited or no prior C++ experience, the early chapters will help you learn essential C++ skills to serve as the basis for the many OOP sections, advanced features, and design patterns.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-21).
### Software and Hardware List
| Chapter | Software required | OS required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 1-21 | Any C++ compiler, minimally C++17 C++20 (recommended) | Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (Any) |

has specialized in object-oriented (OO) technologies since nearly their inception. She began as an early adopter of C++ at General Electric in research and development (R&D). After working on various projects, she was one of 10 charter members to start GE’s Advanced Concepts Center to commercially utilize OO technologies. She later started her own OO training and consulting business, specializing in OOP using C++ and Java. She additionally programs in Python. She has developed and taught many OO courses and has clients spanning industries such as academia, finance, transportation, software, embedded systems, manufacturing, and medical imaging. She has also taught C++ and OO courses at Penn State University.
Ms. Kirk has earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer and Information Sciences from the University of Delaware and a Master of Science degree in Computer Science from Temple University.
Ms. Kirk is married and has two grown children; she and her family live on a horse farm in Pennsylvania.
